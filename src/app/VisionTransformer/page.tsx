          This project was a comprehensive study and implementation of the Vision Transformer(Vit) architecture as proposed in the Google
          paper from 2020. This project was undertaken to both understand the general transformer model and its use when
          applied to the computer vision task of image classifcation. The transformer model itself was originally used
          for natural language processing tasks and would later go on to be the base for models like ChatGPT.
